def pak(s):
    return s.replace(" ", " pak ")

'''
In Bali, as far as I can gather, when ex-pats speak to locals, they basically
 insert the word 'Pak' as often as possible. I am assured it means something
 like 'mate' or 'sir' but that could be completely wrong.

This kata requires you to turn any sentence provided (s) into ex-pat balinese
 waffle by inserting the word 'pak' between every other word.

Pak should not be the first or last word.
 Strings of just spaces should return an empty string.
