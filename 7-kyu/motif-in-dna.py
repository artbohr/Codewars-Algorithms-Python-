'''
In genetics, a sequence’s motif is a nucleotides (or amino-acid) sequence pattern.
Sequence motifs have a biological significance. For more information you can take a look here.

For this kata you need to complete the function motif_locator. This function
receives 2 arguments - a sequence and a motif. Both arguments are strings.

You should return an array that contains all the start positions of the motif
(in order). A sequence may contain 0 or more repetitions of the given motif.
Note that the number of the first position is 1, not 0.

Some examples:

    For the sequence "ACGTGGGGACTAGGGG" and the motif "GGGG" the result should be [5, 13].
    For the sequence "ACCGTACCAAGGGACC" and the motif "AAT" the result should be []
    For the sequence "GGG" and the motif "GG" the result should be [1, 2]
